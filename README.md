## Markdown for Communication or documentation

Welcome to **this awesome** repository. Github markdown is simple to use.  This documentation provides essentials to create a portfolio. A Heading with introduction, an image, some links and lists.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself... I am Nava.

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added an issue for you to check out.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!
