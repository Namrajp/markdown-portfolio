# Litte bit about me
Hi I am Namraj Pudasaini. I live in Sydney. I am learning Markdowns. 
**Markdown is interesting** because we can write our projects summary and *make profile on online space* in github and can even make making web pages easier using jekyll. For Basic markdown [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)and for advanced users [Extended Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#:~:text=In%20Markdown%20applications%20that%20support,brackets%20(%20%5Bx%5D%20)).
