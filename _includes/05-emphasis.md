### Emphasis of text can be italics or bold. 
- To make text italics single hyphen or asterik wraps the text, to make bold we need double hyphen or asterik with no space.
- Example *This is italics* and also _this is same_
- **T is for Tis** and the Women are __The opposite of men__

__bold line__  
another way to __emhasis__ is like single _symbol_ or *letter*
